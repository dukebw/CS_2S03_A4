Hello, I'm Brendan Duke. This is an assignment I wrote for Computer Science
2S03: Principles of Programming in Fall 2014. The purpose of the assignment
was to implement different varieties of data structures (linked lists, stacks
and queues) and to test those implementations comprehensively using JUnit.
